Data-Science-Capstone-Project
==============================

Repo containing the final Capstone Project for Data Science with Python Career Program by Skill Academy. The Capstone project is based on Car Details dataset, and the aim is to perform EDA on the given Dataset and train and evaluate a model to predict the price of car & give results based on the parameters given by the user. & deploy on streamlit.
